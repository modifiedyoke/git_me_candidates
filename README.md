Class coding challenge - retrieve and save Github user data

## Work in progress
This code is not complete, but there is some functionality

## Usage
In order to use this, you'll need to clone the repositry, then add your own Github API key to the code. You could either create a .env file and add it there, or hard-code it into the API.tsx file.

Then 'npm install' and 'npm run dev' from the root directory.
